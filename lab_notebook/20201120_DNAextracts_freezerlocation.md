### DNA extracts are stored in the -80oC freezer [see freezer database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TA0x9hPe6B8G34A2ID93ebjxdaGcEiMHAAajCyuQqo/edit#gid=0):

  - Note that these boxes contain all extracts, including low yield extracts: sample/tube IDs = 7, 19-20, 30 THROUGH 43, 46, 50, 61, some of which were sucessfully re-extracted. REFER TO THE DATABASE https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsb41ZlVDm029fumGS6wH2rgP8YyBvYq6LbtekpVMCk/edit#gid=0 COLUMN "ENOUGH FOR DDRAD" TO FIND THE LIST OF 62 SAMPLES THAT were used for ddRADseq.
