Elise Koob and Bill Hoffman have been catching Black Sea Bass YOY in Mass Bay as bycatch for a winter flounder survey.

Some of the samples were collected and put in (old, potentially dirty) glass vials, and some were collected and put in bags in the freezer.

On Sept 27, KEL prepared 50 falcon tubes with 95% molecular grade ethanol (200 proof) and molecular grade water.

Up until now, Elise told me they caught 5 fish two weeks ago, and 20 fish last week. Here is a picture of the fish:
