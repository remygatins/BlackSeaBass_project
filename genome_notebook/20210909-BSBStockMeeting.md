## Feedback:

- Jason McNamee - NC might be tricky place to sample for the range center given how close it is to the southern stock - general understanding is Hatteras and North is the "northern" stock, but get too close to Hatteras could get mixture with the southern stock - thinks more like Northern NJ would be better range center - CRRF study fleet and trawl survey - he can put us in contact with folks
- Anna Mercer - also works with fisherman to retain sublegal fish - can help with contact with folks
- Elise Koob - getting age 0 BSB in Mass Bay, still sampling on Tuesdays,
 will touch base
