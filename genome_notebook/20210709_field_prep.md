KATIE:
- [ ] cryo training on Bioraft

thais:
- barcode labels
- data collection
- bleach soluation
- test if barcodes fall off in liquid N2
- print barcodes after we get spreadsheets

Jon:
- fish board with measuring tape
- another cooler
- datasheets
**- euthanization protocol**
  - put them on ice. 
  - bring back 50 big fish. add a tag number and collect lat/long. fish board and picture. add a waterproof piece of paper in the bag for the unique IDs to label the fish.
  - Jon will meet us and put in freezer
**- grabowski lab truck keys and stuff**
  - gas on P-card and charge to Jon's overhead  


### Catch a fish: PRINT DATASHEET
- Add a Tag_ID and take data on the:
  - Tag_Id
  - Lat 
  - Long
  - Date
  - Time
  - photo (yes/no) with the date/time/location/tagID in the photo
- Take Photo for length on fish board
- If fish is greater than 30 cm, put it on ice and bring back for Jon - up to 50 fish
- If fish is less than 30 cm put in live well

### Grabowski fish
- add a waterproof piece of paper in the bag for the unique IDs to label the fish.
  - Jon will meet us and put in freezer

### RNA sampling - PRINT DATASHEET
- clean surface with bleach solution and ethanol and RNAase away
- clean tools with ethanol and RNAase away
- prepare vials for brain, liver, and muscle, heart
  - if it is a larger fish, prepare :
    - cryovials for each tissue (label for vialID, label for indID, label for tissue and buffer)
    - RNAlater for each tissue (label for vialID, label for indID, label for tissue and buffer)
  - if it is a smaller fish, prepare:
    - cryovials for each tissue (label for vialID, label for indID, label for tissue and buffer)
  - also prepare a vial for finclip in ethanol
- prepare dataset
  - tag_ID, 
- catch fish from live well
- 


RNA_later
- cut large tissue samples to ≤0.5 cm in any single dimension
- Place the fresh tissue in 5–10 volumes of RNAlater® Solution
- store at 4°C overnight (to allow the solution to thoroughly penetrate the tissue), remove supernatant, then move to –20°C or –80°C for long-term storage


Labels we need:
- for the first 24 small fish, we need 
  - 5 copies of each unique_fish_ID
- 
- 24 of each of:
  -
