## Field notes
- Took 5.5 min to sample the 5 tissues (fin, muscle, liver, heart, brain) + 2.5 min to clean > 8min total (Cryo/RNAlater)
- Tissues stored in RNAlater need to be stored in the fridge for 1 night then transfer to -20 C (RNAlater tissues were at room temp until 9pm, then they were placed at 4C for ~3.5 days, then they were stored at -20C).
