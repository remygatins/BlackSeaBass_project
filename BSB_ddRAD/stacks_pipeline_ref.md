  - 

Paths:

Working directory: /work/lotterhos/2020_NOAA_BlackSeaBass_ddRADb/Lotterhos_Project_001/stacks_ref
Reference genome:   
Trimmed sequences: /work/lotterhos/2020_NOAA_BlackSeaBass_ddRADb/Lotterhos_Project_001/stacks/samples/no_adapter/process_radtags 

## Demultiplex, trim, and quality check
Samples have already been demultiplexed previously (see Thais'[pipeline.md](https://github.com/thais-neu/BlackSeaBass_project/blob/master/BSB_ddRAD/pipeline.md))

For trimming and quality check see [stacks_pipeline.md](https://github.com/remygatins/BlackSeaBass_project/edit/master/BSB_ddRAD/stacks_pipeline.md)
