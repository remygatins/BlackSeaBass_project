In STACKS- Keep all SNPs

1. Check related individuals with vcf using vcftools (--relatedness)
3. Transform from vcf to (plink to) raw (https://github.com/laurabenestan/RDA_outlier)
4. Read about filtering (https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/pruning-vs-clumping.html)
5. Filter the raw data using `snp_autoSVD` (it's at the end of the tutorial) (https://privefl.github.io/bigsnpr/articles/how-to-PCA.html)


For Structure use LEA program	sNMF package vcf input in R. (http://membres-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/LEA/tutorial.htm)

Demographic history
  - Ne by population or range expansion vs northern range
  - PSMC
  - MSMC
  - Convice Katie the program I want to apply is relevant to the study question

Genetic diversity statistics with Latitude
  - Allelic richness
  - He Ho
  - Nucleotide diversity
  - FST Global and pairwise
  - If the RADseq data shows good coverage accross the genome then we will look for outliers
