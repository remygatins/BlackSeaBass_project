# EecSeq library notes
Meeting with Jacob Green and Amy from the Puritz lab
12/08/2021

- 3 probe synthesis for ~150 individuals (Amy)
- more individuals by location than different tissues

We will denormalize so expression does not really change by tissue (depends on the question)

10 individuals per population ~ 8 populations

Zymo kit to extract DNA/RNA instead of Qiagen and TriReagent
mRNA Roche Hyperprep

  - timed steps broken into chunks

mRNA capture- Kapa mRNA HyperPrep Kit 1/2 reaction but use 4000ng to start. 
Order Adapter from [iDT](https://www.idtdna.com/pages)

See [EecSeq Reagent Starter Kit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1polVCSltmnFNgS6jBwQDmJ5t35H7x4LF7pau-WiI0LI/edit#gid=0) for a complete list of kits/reactants needed

**Rough Timeline**
- Day 1- RNA extraction. 
- Day 2- Anneal adapters (can be done a day before the capture) & mRNA capture. 
- Day 3- DSN prep early morning - DSN   
  - plates are hard so pooling before this step is ideal. 
  - should not do more than 3 at a time. 
- Day 4- Cleanup and quantify. 
  split cDNA libraries to use half for probes and half for storage or sequencing. Can go back and make more probes from this  backup. 
- Day 5- Probe Synthesis. 
     - Biotin labelling- 12- hour incubation (they sue 12 hour). 
- Day 6- gDNA prep. 
- Day 7- Capture. 
        500 ng of probes for with 500 ng of gDNA. 
        48 hour incubation for 65 C (spin down at 24 hours). 
- Day 8- Washing (4 or 5 washes)/ Re-amplification/ Quant/ Verify (Although these last two can be done the next day)
       morning making all solutions. 
       save tubes to make sure you are not washing away your library. 

Note: use sonicator to fragment to 150bp and not enzymatic solution. 
However, it can be done with enzymatic solution but need to wash EDTA out. 

**Adapters:**  
Sala/Salb are the universal adapters. 
Ncol is another restriction enzyme that can be used, and has been used in the past but they mostly only use the SAil enzyme now
