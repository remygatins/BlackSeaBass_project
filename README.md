Thais' notebook BSB genomics

 * [Sample locations are in the -80oC freezer inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TA0x9hPe6B8G34A2ID93ebjxdaGcEiMHAAajCyuQqo/edit?ts=5db7258c#gid=0)
   * filter for `Owner`==`Thais`
     * BSB_NC_Box Fin clips OGL Buffer
     * BSB_SMC_ME_Box Fin clips (buffer?)
     * BSB_MD_Box fin clips in OGL buffer
     * BSB_NJ_BOX Fin clips in OGL buffer

    * First tab: `Fin_Clip_Vial_ID` is the vial ID
    * Tab: `selected for genomics` has 64 samples that Thais extracted last March, Thais thinks the extracts are in the boxes in the -80C (even though these boxes say tissue, she thinks they are the extracts).
       * BSB_NC_Box Fin clips OGL Buffer
       * BSB_SMC_ME_Box Fin clips (buffer?)
       * BSB_MD_Box fin clips in OGL buffer
       * BSB_NJ_BOX Fin clips in OGL buffer
   * remaining samples
     * ~20-25 samples from RI in the freezer - Katie thinks this is the box in the -20C
       * we need to check the length data, but we can extract all these
     * Marissa has <10 samples from ME
       * waiting to receive them from Marissa
 
* [Notebook](https://github.com/thais-neu/BlackSeaBass_project/blob/master/lab_notebook/2020-01-BSB-DNA-extraction.md)
    * Up to March 12, was troubleshooting 
    * Unique_ID is what is used to match to datasheet
    * Thais made some changes to the entry 2020-01-BSB-DNA-extraction_summary.md to clarify dilution factors used to measure sample concentrations using Qubit and to provide a separate table listing the 62 extracted samples to be sent out to sequencing facility.

* Sequencing facility contact info: 
    * "We request DNA to be sent with volumes >20 ul and concentrations >25 ng/ul as measured by Picogreen or Qubit since Nanodrop will tend to overestimate the amount of double stranded DNA available. However, we input 10 ul of DNA at 10 ng/ul into our GBS library preparation, so DNA >10 ng/ul as measured by Picogreen or Qubit is acceptable. Our library prep rate includes an initial Picogreen QC step, and we can still attempt library prep on sequencing on samples with concentrations <10 ng/ul. We have successfully sequenced samples with initial concentrations <5 ng/ul, however, the results are more variable and we cannot guarantee that the samples will be successful."
    * Email: Evan Forsberg    GBS Service Manager    1-202 NHH    312 Church St SE    Minneapolis, MN 55455    (612) 624-3177    GBS@umn.edu
    * Thais will forward correspondence to Katie and Alan
    * Budget: ~$7000-$9000

* [Extraction protocol](https://github.com/thais-neu/BlackSeaBass_project/blob/master/lab_protocols/DNA-extraction-kits.md)
   * May need to purchase another kit (~$1000)
   * E.Z.N.A tissue DNA kit (D3396-02, Omega) - tubes (T) method
   * if we use plates, may need to go to Randall's lab
   * Use elution volume less of what they tell you to do (~30uL instead of 100uL for first elution and 70uL out of second elution), stored separately and not combined. Thais checked 2nd elution and not much there.
      *  Sara used to use 1/2 the elution volume for her samples, then she combined them
 
 TO DO:
 
 * Sample summary
    * RI samples (southern new england) - data not organized
        * Sample location is our freezer
        * 22 to extract/sequence
    * MA samples from Sept 2020 - where are these stored?
        * Thais gave EtOH vials to them
        * Tommy and Jonathon collected and processed them on the boat
        * In door of standing -20C freezer in Grabowski Lab
        * 20-30: extract as many as we can that are less than 30
    * NJ "conflict" - no date? Fixed with Jon/thais
        * thais has a spreadsheet that came with these samples
        * 
    * NC samples - no date? Fixed with Jon/thais
    * ME list - this is a list of vials that Thais sent to Marissa, but never sent back to us
        * Thais says that Marissa didn't enter information to big spreadsheet - Thais made a separate one
        * thais will enter details - June and Nov 2020
        * 15 samples, 9 are smaller than 30cM and 2 marked as YOY
        * Jon will get Marissa to send the finclips

 * Sample summary extracted by Thais (62 samples)
    * NJ 17
    * MD 20
    * Seouthern NE 7
    * ME 5
    * NC 13
    
 
 * Katie
    * Confirm all samples with Jon
    * Get remaining finclips and data from ME - Marissa
    * Quotes from sequencing facility `quote ddRAD library prep and sequencing` email thread
    * Data quality control - we're not sure if these data are entered yet
        * thais entered vial IDs for Maine samples, because she setn to Marissa
        * thais entered vial IDs for RI/MA samples, because she setn to Jon
 
 * Thais: Go through data in this [spreadsheet](https://github.com/thais-neu/BlackSeaBass_project/blob/master/lab_notebook/2020-01-BSB-DNA-extraction_summary.md) and transfer to the [Black sea bass shared datasheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsb41ZlVDm029fumGS6wH2rgP8YyBvYq6LbtekpVMCk/edit#gid=0).
   * Thais will move this data into the [database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsb41ZlVDm029fumGS6wH2rgP8YyBvYq6LbtekpVMCk/edit#gid=690341558)
   * Thais thinks we can sequence all of them
   * Notes in right column are based on concentration and volume:
     * plenty: for all samples which we have quantity from Sequencing facility
     * acceptable, could retry: we have enough, but the concentrations are greater than 5 and less than 25ng/uL
     * `repeated` had to extract twice,  some samples we have less than 5
 * Alan: extractions 
    * extract remaining samples
    * quantify all samples we plan to send to sequencing on plate reader
    * prepare for sequencing requried by sequencing facility
    * help with shipping to sequencing facility
