Thais' notebook BSB genomics

 * [Sample locations are in the -80oC freezer inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TA0x9hPe6B8G34A2ID93ebjxdaGcEiMHAAajCyuQqo/edit?ts=5db7258c#gid=0)
  * filter for `Owner`==`Thais`
    * BSB_NC_Box Fin clips OGL Buffer
    * BSB_SMC_ME_Box Fin clips (buffer?)
    * BSB_MD_Box fin clips in OGL buffer
    * BSB_NJ_BOX Fin clips in OGL buffer

 
 * [Black sea bass shared datasheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsb41ZlVDm029fumGS6wH2rgP8YyBvYq6LbtekpVMCk/edit#gid=0)
  * First tab: `Fin_Clip_Vial_ID` is the vial ID
  * Tab: `selected for genomics` has 64 samples that Thais extracted last March, Thais thinks the extracts are in the boxes in the -80C (even though these boxes say tissue, she thinks they are the extracts).
    * BSB_NC_Box Fin clips OGL Buffer
    * BSB_SMC_ME_Box Fin clips (buffer?)
    * BSB_MD_Box fin clips in OGL buffer
    * BSB_NJ_BOX Fin clips in OGL buffer
  * remaining samples
    * ~20-25 samples from RI in the freezer - Katie thinks this is the box in the -20C
      * we need to check the length data, but we can extract all these
    * Marissa has <10 samples from ME
      * waiting to receive them from Marissa
 
 * Sequencing facility contact info: 
 
 TO DO:
 
 * Confirm all samples with Jon
 * Get remaining finclips and data from
