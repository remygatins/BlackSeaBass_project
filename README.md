Thais' notebook BSB genomics

 * [Sample locations are in the -80oC freezer inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12TA0x9hPe6B8G34A2ID93ebjxdaGcEiMHAAajCyuQqo/edit?ts=5db7258c#gid=0)
   * filter for `Owner`==`Thais`
     * BSB_NC_Box Fin clips OGL Buffer
     * BSB_SMC_ME_Box Fin clips (buffer?)
     * BSB_MD_Box fin clips in OGL buffer
     * BSB_NJ_BOX Fin clips in OGL buffer

  * First tab: `Fin_Clip_Vial_ID` is the vial ID
  * Tab: `selected for genomics` has 64 samples that Thais extracted last March, Thais thinks the extracts are in the boxes in the -80C (even though these boxes say tissue, she thinks they are the extracts).
    * BSB_NC_Box Fin clips OGL Buffer
    * BSB_SMC_ME_Box Fin clips (buffer?)
    * BSB_MD_Box fin clips in OGL buffer
    * BSB_NJ_BOX Fin clips in OGL buffer
  * remaining samples
    * ~20-25 samples from RI in the freezer - Katie thinks this is the box in the -20C
      * we need to check the length data, but we can extract all these
    * Marissa has <10 samples from ME
      * waiting to receive them from Marissa

  * Up to March 12, was troubleshooting 
  * Unique_ID is what is used to match to datasheet

* Sequencing facility contact info: 
   * "We request DNA to be sent with volumes >20 ul and concentrations >25 ng/ul as measured by Picogreen or Qubit since Nanodrop will tend to overestimate the amount of double stranded DNA available. However, we input 10 ul of DNA at 10 ng/ul into our GBS library preparation, so DNA >10 ng/ul as measured by Picogreen or Qubit is acceptable. Our library prep rate includes an initial Picogreen QC step, and we can still attempt library prep on sequencing on samples with concentrations <10 ng/ul. We have successfully sequenced samples with initial concentrations <5 ng/ul, however, the results are more variable and we cannot guarantee that the samples will be successful."

* Extraction protocol

 TO DO:
 
 * Confirm all samples with Jon
 * Get remaining finclips and data from ME - Marissa
 * Go through data in this [spreadsheet](https://github.com/thais-neu/BlackSeaBass_project/blob/master/lab_notebook/2020-01-BSB-DNA-extraction_summary.md) and transfer to the [Black sea bass shared datasheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsb41ZlVDm029fumGS6wH2rgP8YyBvYq6LbtekpVMCk/edit#gid=0).
   * Thais will move this data into the [database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nsb41ZlVDm029fumGS6wH2rgP8YyBvYq6LbtekpVMCk/edit#gid=690341558)
   * Thais thinks we can sequence all of them
   * Notes in right column are based on concentration and volume:
     * plenty: for all samples which we have quantity from Sequencing facility
     * acceptable, could retry: we have enough, but the concentrations are greater than 5 and less than 25ng/uL
     * `repeated` had to extract twice,  some samples we have less than 5
