## Objective 1
  - lack of detail of sampling locations and effort at each of them, and possible confounding effects due to year of sampling.
    - Consider cohort effect. Age them ~ temporal genotype
    - estimate scale of dispersal
     - Gen dist vs Fst (Lotterhos paper .. rockfish)

## Objective 2
  - concerns that the body condition parameters in ectotherms are all correlated to temperature, which is what is actually driving the range shift in this species (latitude). 
  - They suggest finding other ways to measure fitness, not correlated to temperature, to disentangle this limitation.
  - control for sex

## Objective 3
  - include fisheries data ~ size selection
    - model contrasting cases (e.g., del mut, + adaptation, + adaptation + fishing... etc)
